## Java ES6 Project Repository
This repository contains a series of JavaScript ES6 (ECMAScript 6) concept files. JavaScript ES6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, is the version of JavaScript that introduces new features and concepts that are fundamental to modern JavaScript development.

Each file in this repository is designed to provide a clear understanding of different JavaScript concepts.

## Files in the Repository
Here are the files available in this repository along with a brief description:

1. `CallApplyBind.js`: This file demonstrates the usage and differences of the call, apply and bind methods in JavaScript, which are all used to change the context of 'this'.

2. `Clousers.js`: The file explains JavaScript closures, a concept that allows an inner function to access the scope of an outer function.

3. `Currying.js`: Demonstrates currying, a technique of transforming a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions each with a single argument.

4. `Function.js`: Contains examples and explanations of function definitions and scopes in JavaScript.

5. `Generators.js`: This file demonstrates the use of JavaScript Generators, a special type of function that works as a factory for iterators.

6. `IteratorIterables.js`: This file illustrates JavaScript iterators and iterables, demonstrating how to create custom iterations over objects.

7. `JsonObject.js`: Provides examples and explanations on handling JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) in JavaScript.

8. `objects.js`: This file covers object creation, manipulation, and traversal in JavaScript.

9. `Prototype.js`: Demonstrates the use of JavaScript prototypes, an object from which other objects inherit properties.

10. `PrototypeClassInheritance.js`: This file provides an overview of class-based inheritance as implemented in JavaScript through prototypes.

11. `PrototypeInheritance.js`: It offers detailed insights into Prototype-based inheritance, a form of object-oriented code organization in JavaScript that doesn't involve classes.

12. `ProtoypeChain.js`: Demonstrates the prototype chain, which is the basis for JavaScript's prototype-based inheritance model.

13. `Scopes.js`: This file covers the concept of Scopes in JavaScript including block scope, function scope and lexical scope.

14. `ThisKeyword.js`: Provides a detailed understanding of 'this' keyword in JavaScript, an important concept that refers to the context in which a function is called.

## How to use these files?
Each file can be executed separately using Node.js. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine, then use the command node filename.js to run the file.
